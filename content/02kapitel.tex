The following theoretical basics are summarized from the standard literature in optics \autocite{bornPrinciplesOpticsElectromagnetic1999,hechtOptik2005,lipsonOptik1997,niedrigOptikWellenUnd2004} and more specifically Raman application \autocite{herzbergMolecularSpectraMolecular2013,schraderInfraredRamanSpectroscopy1995}.

\subsection*{Temperature calculation}
\label{subsec:temp-eval}

The plot of the change of scattered intensities over the Raman shift is illustrated in \autoref{fig:plot-temp}. The isosbestic point can be determined at roughly $3390 \mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, via the lowest standard deviation of all the normalized data sets. The areas can be interpreted as the integration of the curve within the boundaries $[3390~\mathrm{cm^{-1}},~3800~\mathrm{cm^{-1}}]$ for $A_\mathrm{right}$, and $[2600~\mathrm{cm^{-1}},~3390~\mathrm{cm^{-1}}]$ for $A_\mathrm{left}$. Due to the already integrating behavior of the CCD sensor, it is calculated as the sum of all data points within the presented ranges.

With the record of a temperature calibration curve, a function with the form
\begin{align}
    T(x)=42.1 \cdot x^3 - 200.5 \cdot x^2 + 412.4 \cdot x -233.7
\end{align}
can be fitted to calculate the temperature of the liquid through putting in the area ratios $x$. The in between results and the final temperature for the highest and the lowest temperature curve are shown in \autoref{tab:temp}. Compared to the measurement with the thermocouple K, there is a mean error of $3.46~\mathrm{K}$, and a mean squared error of $12.83~\mathrm{K}$ over all measurements.
