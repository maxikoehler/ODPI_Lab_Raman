\label{chap:summary}

The experiment successfully demonstrated the working principles of Raman spectroscopy and how it can be utilized to measure concentrations and temperature. Although the accuracy of the results of this experiment is error-prone, the approximate molar fraction and volumetric concentration were determined to be $x_\mathrm{EtOH,unknown} \approx 0.5$ and $x_\mathrm{V,EtOH}=0.75$, respectively. If the experimental setup were to be used in a context where accuracy is critical, the calibration and measurement procedure would have to be improved, so that the error can be quantified and minimized.
